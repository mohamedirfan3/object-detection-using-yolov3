## Introduction
YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, version 3) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. It is fast and accurate, making it suitable for a variety of applications including surveillance, self-driving cars, and more.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-using-yolo-v3.git
    cd object-detection-using-yolo-v3
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the YOLOv3 weights from the official [YOLO website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/). Place the weights file in the `weights` directory.

## Usage
To run the object detection using YOLOv3, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook object_detection_using_yolo_v3.ipynb
    ```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code cells. The notebook includes sections for:
    - Setting up the environment
    - Loading the model and weights
    - Running object detection on images and videos
    - Visualizing the results

## Results
The notebook demonstrates object detection on various images and videos. You can visualize the bounding boxes and class labels predicted by the YOLOv3 model.
